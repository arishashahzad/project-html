          <h5 class="card-title">UPRIGHT </h5>
          <p class="card-text">An exercise bike that you’ve probably seen in the gym is an upright option. A distinct feature of an upright exercise bike is that it features an adjustable seat with handles and pedals at the front that go up and down instead of side to side. This stationary bike is very similar to a physical one. Additionally, like most exercise bikes, an upright option will have a screen attached to it as well.  </p>

    <div class="col">
      
        <div class="card-body bg-secondary">
          <h5 class="card-title">RECUMBENT   </h5>
          <p class="card-text">A recumbent bike is a bit different compared to an upright one and is probably the most unique option Precor Home Fitness has to offer. What sets a recumbent bike apart form an upright bike is that is features a seat that is lower to the ground, positioned further back, and is in a reclined position. A recumbent bike also has handles in the back by the seat along with a pair at the front as well.</p>

    <div class="col">
      
        <div class="card-body bg-secondary">
          <h5 class="card-title">SPINNER </h5>
          <p class="card-text">nother type of exercise bike you can find at Precor Home Fitness is a spinner, also known as a studio bike. A spinner bike closely resembles a regular bike, but with a major distinction regarding the seat position. While the handle of a spinner bike will be in the normal position at the front of the machine, the seat will also be in the same position; however, there is room for adjustments.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">AIR BIKE </h5>
          <p class="card-text">If you are looking for a different type of cycling challenge, then an air bike may be the option for you. The easiest way to spot an air bike is by the fan that is located near the pedals. The purpose of the fan on an air bike is to add resistance as you pedal, which will blow more the harder you pedal.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">CARDIO STRIDER </h5>
        <p class="card-text">A final option you have for an exercise bike-like machine is a cardio strider. Unlike a traditional exercise bike, the pedals don’t move in a 180-degree motion. Instead, a cardio strider acts more like a stair master with low steps, but the seating position is similar to a recumbent bike. </p>

      <center><h1 class="fw-bold bg-secondary">Cycling for health and fitness</h1></center>
  
      <p>It only takes two to four hours a week to achieve a general improvement to your health. Cycling is:</p>
      <p>Low impact – it causes less strain and injuries than most other forms of exercise.</p>
  <p>A good muscle workout– cycling uses all of the major muscle groups as you pedal./p>
  <p>Good for strength and stamina– cycling increases stamina, strength and aerobic fitness.</p>
  <p>As intense as you want– cycling can be done at very low intensity to begin with, if recovering from injury or illness, but can be built up to a demanding physical workout.</p>
  <p>A fun way to get fit– the adventure and buzz you get from coasting down hills and being outdoors means you are more likely to continue to cycle regularly, compared to other physical activities that keep you indoors or require special times or places.</p>
  <p>Time-efficient – as a mode of transport, cycling replaces sedentary (sitting) time spent driving motor vehicles or using trams, trains or buses with healthy exercise.</p>

  <div class="health issue">
    <center><h1 class="bg-secondary">Cycling and specific health issues</h5></center>
<p>Cycling can improve both physical and mental health, and can reduce the chances of experiencing many health problems.</p>

<h5 class="fw-bolder">Obesity and weight control</h5>
<p>Cycling is a good way to control or reduce weight, as it raises your metabolic rate, builds muscle and burns body fat. If you’re trying to lose weight, cycling must be combined with a healthy eating plan. Cycling is a comfortable form of exercise and you can change the time and intensity – it can be built up slowly and varied to suit you.</p>

<p>Research suggests you should be burning at least 8,400 kilojoules (about 2,000 calories) a week through exercise. Steady cycling burns about 1,200 kilojoules (about 300 calories) per hour.</p>

<p>If you cycle twice a day, the kilojoules burnt soon add up. British research shows that a half-hour bike ride every day will burn nearly five kilograms of fat over a year.</p>

<h5 class="fw-bolder">Cardiovascular disease and cycling</h5>
<p>Cardiovascular diseases include stroke, high blood pressure and heart attack. Regular cycling stimulates and improves your heart, lungs and circulation, reducing your risk of cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Cycling strengthens your heart muscles, lowers resting pulse and reduces blood fat levels. Research also shows that people who cycle to work have two to three times less exposure to pollution than car commuters, so their lung function is improved. A Danish study conducted over 14 years with 30,000 people aged 20 to 93 years found that regular cycling protected people from heart disease.</p>

<h5 class="fw-bolder">Cancer and cycling</h5>
<p>Many researchers have studied the relationship between exercise and cancer, especially colon and breast cancer. Research has shown that if you cycle, the chance of bowel cancer is reduced. Some evidence suggests that regular cycling reduces the risk of breast cancer.</p>

<h5 class="fw-bolder">Diabetes and cycling</h5>
<p>The rate of type 2 diabetes is increasing and is a serious public health concern. Lack of physical activity is thought to be a major reason why people develop this condition. Large-scale research in Finland found that people who cycled for more than 30 minutes per day had a 40 per cent lower risk of developing diabetes.</p>

<h5 class="fw-bolder">Bone injuries, arthritis and cycling</h5>
<p>Cycling improves strength, balance and coordination. It may also help to prevent falls and fractures. Riding a bike is an ideal form of exercise if you have osteoarthritis, because it is a low-impact exercise that places little stress on joints.</p>
<p>Cycling does not specifically help osteoporosis (bone-thinning disease) because it is not a weight-bearing exercise.</p>

<h5 class="fw-bolder"1>Mental illness and cycling</h5>
<p>Mental health conditions such as depression, stress and anxiety can be reduced by regular bike riding. This is due to the effects of the exercise itself and because of the enjoyment that riding a bike can bring.</p>

<h5 class="fw-bolder">Hand cycling and health</h5>
<p>Hand cycles are similar to recumbent tricycles, but they are powered with hand instead of foot pedals. Velcro straps can be used to secure the hands to the pedals if necessary.</p>
<p>This style of tricycle allows amputees, people with spinal injuries and those recovering from certain conditions such as stroke to cycle as a form of exercise and recreation. Hand cyclists get cardiovascular and aerobic benefits similar to those of other cyclists.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>With its low impact on the joints and high caloric burn rate, cycling is a great choice for anyone wanting to get (and stay) in shape. It is accessible to all fitness levels and allows for easy progression. At all levels, cycling demands extreme physical effort and stamina to power the bicycle and to maintain correct form and speed, especially if for an extended time. Most of the work is in pushing down on the pedal, which uses all of the muscles in the leg. Equally important are the supporting muscles, which support the upper body, provide balance, reduce fatigue and increase endurance.</p>
<p>Anatomy of Cycling addresses all of these needs. The exercises are designed to work the wide range of muscles that come into play when cycling. All of them can be done at home using just seven items: a mat, a chair, a "Bosu ball," a small medicine ball, a large Swiss Ball, a small roller and a large roller.</p>
<p>The exercises are organized into four units:</p>
<p>Flexibility Exercises: Mostly stretches, these help to counteract stiffness and increase blood flow.</p>
<p>Leg-Strengthening Exercises: Legs power the bicycle and by pedaling faster, gain speed. Strength is essential to sprinting and hill-climbing skills. These weight-bearing exercises are also beneficial to bones, a benefit that a cycling-only regimen lacks.</p>
<p>Core-Strengthening Exercises: A strong core contributes to a fluid pedal stroke, energy efficiency and overall stability.</p>
<p>Balance and Posture Exercises: These exercises, including swimming, help to build back strength and improve stability, both helpful in counteracting the shoulder and lower back problems that trouble cyclists.</p>
<p>Anatomy of Cycling also includes three pre-designed workouts -- Beginner's, Intermediate and Advanced -- as well as seven specific workouts: Quadriceps-Strengthening, Healthy Back, Core-Stabilizing, Low-Impact, Stamina, Balancing and Postural.</p>
<p>This is an essential reference for road cyclists and triathletes.</p>

<div class="diesease">
  <center><h1 class="bg-secondary">How cycling combats heart disease and cancer</h1></center>
  <div class="diesease">
    <p>Regular cycling stimulates and improves your heart, lungs and circulation, reducing your risk of cardiovascular diseases. Cycling strengthens your heart muscles, lowers resting pulse and reduces blood fat levels.
    </p>
    <p>Cycling is more efficient than walking, so you'll probably work harder by walking briskly and probably exercise your heart, lungs and major muscles more. On the other hand, cycling is probably less hard on your hips, knees and ankles than walking.</p>
