<h1 class="fw-bold">Health benefits of swimming</h1>
<p>Swimming is a great workout because you need to move your whole body against the resistance of the water.</p>
<p>Swimming is a good all-round activity because it:</p>
<p>keeps your heart rate up but takes some of the impact stress off your body</p>
<p>Builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness</p>
<p>Helps you maintain a healthy weight, healthy heart and lungs</p>
<p>Tones muscles and builds strength</p>
<p>Provides an all-over body workout, as nearly all of your muscles are used during swimming.</p>

    <h1 class="fw-bold ">Other benefits of swimming</h1>
    <p>Swimming has many other benefits including:</p>
    <p>being a relaxing and peaceful form of exercise</p>
<p>Alleviating stress</p>
<p>Improving coordination, balance and posture</p>
<p>Improving flexibility</p>
<p>Providing good low-impact therapy for some injuries and conditions</p>
<p>Providing a pleasant way to cool down on a hot day</p>
<p>Being available in many places â€“ you can swim in swimming pools, beaches, lakes, dams and rivers.</p>

 <h1 class="bg-primary">5 basic swimming skills everyone needs to learn</h1>
</div>

<h3>1. Breathing</h3>
<p>This is a frequently overlooked basic skill, but it is an important one. If are not comfortable breathing while swimming, you won't be able to enjoy it completely and learn new things. The basic idea is that you need to breathe out with both your nose and mouth when your head is underwater. Then when you lift your head to the side take a full breath before putting your face back down.</p>
</div>

   <h3>2. Floating</h3>
   <p>Before you start kicking and stroking, first learn to float in the water. Floating helps you to get used to the habit of moving through water properly. Floating helps to keep your body on the surface of the water. Our body experiences a vertical buoyant force when immersed in water and floating helps to keep your body in a horizontal position. Floating is important because if you accidentally fall in the water you will be able to float on the surface till you are rescued.</p>
   </div>
   
 
    <h3>3 Your body movement should be well co-ordinated</h3>
    <p>In swimming, all your body parts should be well co-ordinated with each other. You must be able to move the muscles of your lower back, abdomen, and hips in a synchronized way to keep moving forward. Your hands should move and cut through the water first, followed by your elbow and then your body should make way through the water.
    </p>
    </div>
    
   
        <h3>4 Kicking</h3>
        <p>Kicking is another important skill to learn if you want to master swimming. Kicking helps your body to move in the forward direction. Many swimming coaches use kickboards to support swimmer's body.</p>
        </div>
        
            <h3>5 Strokes</h3>
            <p>Now that you know how to float and kick, it is time to learn some strokes. Strokes are the arm movements that help to pull the body through the water. The front crawl, sidestroke, backstroke, and butterfly are some of the common swimming strokes.</p>

        <h4>Swimming takes place in a medium, that presents different gravitational and resistive forces, respiratory conditions and thermal stress compared to air. The energy cost of propulsion in swimming is high, but a considerable reduction occurs at a given velocity as result of regular swim training. In medley swimmers the energy cost is lowest for front crawl, followed by backstroke, butterfly and breast-stroke. Cardiac output is probably not limiting for performance since swimmers easily achieve higher values during running. Maximal heart rate, however, is lowered by approx. 10 beats/min during swimming compared to running. Most likely active muscle mass is smaller and rate of power production lesser in swimming. Local factors, such as peripheral circulation, capillary density, perfusion pressure and metabolic capacity of active muscles, are important determinants of the power production capacity and emphasize the role of swim specific training movements. Improved swimming technique and efficiency are likely to explain much of the continuous progress in performance. Rational principles based on improved understanding of the biomechanics and physiology of swimming should be guidelines for swimmers and coaches in their efforts to explore the limits of human performance.</h4>

  <h3> This includes stroke, coronary heart disease, and high blood pressure. Being physically active can decrease the chances of a stroke by 31%. Just doing an hour of moderate physical activity each day can decrease the risk of CVD by 20%.</h3></div>
 <center><h1 class="bg-primary">How swimming can prevent heart disease</h1></center>
 <p>So, now we know the issue behind CVD, this is how swimming can prevent heart disease.</p>
 <p>1_Swimming for half an hour a minimum of three times a week can significantly lower blood pressure levels.</p>
 <p>2_It helps you maintain control over your cholesterol levels. The fat burning properties of swimming for 30 minutes increases your chances of reducing dangerous cholesterol like Very Low Density and Low Density Lipoproteins. These can cause high cholesterol levels in the blood.</p>
 <p>3_Swimming boosts your metabolism. 30 minutes in the pool is worth 45 minutes of land based exercise. It also raises good cholesterol levels too!
